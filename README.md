## 🚀 The Mission
In a rapidly evolving 2026 tech landscape, traditional pricing is dead. I built an AI Agent to identify **"Flagship Killers"**—phones that offer premium specs (NPU/AI Power) at budget prices.

## 🧠 Technical Highlights
- **Synthetic Data Engineering:** Generated a 1,000-device dataset based on 2026 hardware trends (NPU TOPS, Foldables).
- **Model:** Used **XGBoost Regressor**, achieving a **96.8% Intelligence Level (R² Score)**.
- **Interactive UI:** Built a custom laboratory interface using `ipywidgets` for real-time price simulation.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **The AI Tax:** NPU performance (TOPS) is now the #2 driver of price, nearly equaling RAM.
- **Screen Saturation:** High refresh rates (165Hz) have become a standard and no longer command a price premium.
